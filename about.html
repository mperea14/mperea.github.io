	<h7><strong>Hobbies</strong></h7>
	<p> I have always been passionate about sports, espcially outdoor sports. Growing up in Colorado allowed me to fall in love with Snowboarding in the Winter and Mountain Biking in the Summer. </p>
	<p> When it comes to competiton, hockey and golf are two of my favorite things to do. From playing on the Wisconsin Club Hockey Team to competing in the Colorado Amatuer and Wisconsin Open golf tournaments, I am always looking for something to do.  </p>
