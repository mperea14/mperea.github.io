	<h2>Hello, Welcome to My Page! </h2> 
	
	<p> My name is Michael "Mikey" Perea and I am currently a student at the <strong>University of Wisconsin - Madison</strong> majoring in Finance, Investment, and Banking along with Risk Management and Insurance. I also am completing a certificate in Digital Studies to improve my abilities in marketing, media and communication. I have also been fortunate enough to play on the Wisconsin Club Hockey team these past few years which even led to a league championship for the first time in program history. 
	</p>
	
	<p> I am originally from <strong> Golden, Colorado</strong>, where I plan to reside after I graduate in May 2023. It is hard to get away from the Mile High City especially as a passionate snowboarder, mountain biker and die-hard Colorado Avalanche fan.
	</p>
<p> After several professional expereinces and leadership roles, I've developed great skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, presentation skills and teamwork. It's always been a passion of mine to intertwine solving problems and interacting with individuals to find solutions and create the best possible outcomes.
